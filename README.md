# 🤖 [Evaluating AI Agents](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/evaluating-ai-agents/)

Welcome to the "Evaluating AI Agents" course! 🎯 This course, created in collaboration with **Arize AI** and taught by **John Gilhuly** (Head of Developer Relations) and **Aman Khan** (Director of Product), will equip you with practical skills to **systematically evaluate, debug, and improve AI agents** during development and deployment.

---

## 📘 Course Summary
This course walks you through the essential tools and techniques to measure and iterate on AI agent performance. You’ll learn to evaluate agent behaviors step-by-step, select the right metrics and evaluators, and run structured experiments to optimize agent outcomes.

### **What You’ll Learn**
1. 🔍 **Observability & Debugging**: Learn how to add tracing to your agents to visualize and debug their actions.
2. 🧪 **Structured Evaluation**: Understand the differences between evaluating traditional software vs. LLM agents, and how to test individual agent components.
3. ⚖️ **Evaluator Selection**: Learn when to use code-based metrics, LLM-as-a-judge, or human annotations for reliable feedback.
4. 🔁 **Running Experiments**: Conduct structured experiments by changing model parameters, prompts, or agent logic to iteratively improve performance.
5. 📊 **Component-Wise Evaluation**: Test agent submodules like skills and router decisions using real examples.
6. 📈 **Production Monitoring**: Deploy these evaluation techniques in production to ensure consistent agent performance over time.
